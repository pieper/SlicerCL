This is a repository of 3D Slicer extension code written using OpenCL
through pyopencl.

These modules are very much a work in progress, and are only
compatible with the current development head of slicer and 
will only work with OpenCL compatible hardware and appropriate
drivers.

Note: because it relies on low level access to hardware devices,
on some systems improperly behaving OpenCL code can lead to 
corrupted graphics displays or system crashes.
