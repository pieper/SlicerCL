This is a repository of 3D Slicer extension code written using OpenCL
through pyopencl.

These modules are very much a work in progress, and are only
compatible with the current development head of slicer and
will only work with OpenCL compatible hardware and appropriate
drivers.

Note: because it relies on low level access to hardware devices,
on some systems improperly behaving OpenCL code can lead to
corrupted graphics displays or system crashes.

Status:
The code can be made to work on linux, windows, or mac with the proper
hardware and drivers.  But you need to install the PyOpenCL package
into slicer's python, and that can be easy or hard depending on
the platform.

Mac/Linux: edit Experiments/slicercl.sh so match your paths and then run it.

Windows: get the binary versions of the packages listed in Experiments/slicercl.sh
either by building from source or by installing the versions from the scipy
download sites.  I have made this work in the past, but don't have binary solutions
available so you are on your own.  Any help automating this would be
much appreciated!
